If you want to be INVINSIBLE on the battlefields, you should not
only understand how to hit enemy but also how to avoid damage.
As the time passes and traning goes, Otto Carius cooperates with
his crew more and more delicate.
At this time a new training course starts:
The Commander distribute oil color shells to every crew,
and all crew started at a corner on a traning field and shoot 
each other -- the grade score will depand on the oil on your 
tank at end of traning -- the less oil you take the more
score you get.
It seems really exciting although it is not a living ammunition 
trainning ---  every one is eager to have a try.

Stage II  "Survival Traning"
in this stage you need to survive within 75 seconds under 24 enemys
fire from 8 orients.
The enemy's attack is random but not intentional.(not same to the
story...)
Victory term: Survive within 75 seconds or destory all enemy
                                           (if you can)
Defeat term: Have you tank destoryed.
Notice: Hide in a corner to avoid being shoot too much.
	If you chose HARD level, the battle will be EXTREMELY exciting.
